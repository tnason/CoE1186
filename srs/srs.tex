\section{Overall description}
Describe the general factors taht affect the product and its requirements. Does not state specific requirements. Provide background for those requirements that are defined in section 3 and clarify them.

     \subsection{Product perspective}
     Put the product into perspective with other related products. State if product is independent/ totally self contained. If product is component of larger system, relate the requirements to the larger system and identify interfaces between system and the software.

          \subsubsection{System Interface}
	  List each system interface and identify the functionality of the software requirements and the interface description to match the system.
	  
	  \subsubsection{User Interface}
	  Logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users. Include configuration characteristics neccessary to accomplish the software requirements.
	  
	  Include aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system. Maybe list of do's and don'ts on how the system will appear to the user. Long/short error messages. Must be verifiable. 
	  
	  \subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
	  Specify logical characteristics of each interface between the software and the hardware components. Include configuration characteristics. Cover what devices are supported, how they are supported and protocols.
	  
	  \subsubsection{Software interfaces}
	  Specify use of other required software products and interfaces with other application systems. For each required software product, provide: Name, mnemonic, specification number, version number and source.

	  For each interface: discuss the purpose of interfacing software as related to this product. Define the interface in terms of message content and format. 

	  \subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
	  Specify the various interfaces to communications sucha as local network protocols etc.

	  \subsubsection{Memory constraints}
	  Specify any applicable characterisitcs and limits on primary and secondary memory.

	  Specify the site or mission related features that should be modified to adapt the software to a particular installation. 

     \subsection{Product functions}
     Provide summary of the major functions of software. Organize function list in a way that is understandable to customer. Text/graphical methods to show different functions and relationships. Not intended to show design of a product but to show logical representation among varaiables.

     \subsection{User characteristics}
     Describe general characteristics of the intended user of the product including education level, experience and technical expertise. Not used to state specific requirements but should provide the reason why certain specific requirements are in section 3.

     \subsection{Apportioning of requirements}
     Identify requirements that may be delayed untiol future versions of the system.
     
\section{Specific requirements}
Contains all software requirements to a level of detail sufficent to enabel the designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements. Every stated requirement should be externally perceivable by users, operators or other external systems. At minimum, a description of each input (stimulus) into the system, every output (response) from the system and all functions performed bt the system in response to an input or in support of an output. 

\vspace{12pt}

     \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
     \item{Specific requirements should be stated in conformace with all characteristics described in 4.3 of recommended practices.}
     \item{Specific requirements shoudl be cross-referenced wiht earlier documents that relate.}
     \item{All reuirements should be uniquely identifiable.}
     \item{Careful attention given to oragnization of requirements for readability.}
     \end{enumerate}

     \subsection{External interfaces}
